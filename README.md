## Tern Folbaek

Natural sciences are what got me hooked on software programming. The creation of software technology through manipulating the behavior of the real world, which is still largely unknown to us, is what drove me to this field. Creating new technologies, optimizing existing ones, and solving problems is what makes me happy.

My repositories range from practical apps that I found useful to projects that help me understand complex topics on a deeper level. These projects are designed to assist others in learning those topics more easily and intuitively.

### Apps:
- [Anthra - Platform for students across universities and courses to connect with each other](https://github.com/TernFolbaek/anthra) <sup>ðŸ”—</sup>  
  An educational platform designed to help students collaborate across institutions and disciplines.

### Quantum Computation:
- [Single Systems - Quantum information and mathematics within single systems](https://github.com/TernFolbaek/quantum-computing/tree/main/basics-of-quantum-information/single_systems) <sup>ðŸ”—</sup>  
  A deep dive into quantum information theory applied to individual quantum systems.
- [Multiple Systems - Quantum information and mathematics within multiple systems](https://github.com/TernFolbaek/quantum-computing/tree/main/basics-of-quantum-information/multiple-systems) <sup>ðŸ”—</sup>  
  Exploration of the principles of quantum mechanics applied to systems with more than one quantum entity.

### Machine Learning:
- [ML Regularization - Techniques within machine learning to reduce overfitting](https://github.com/TernFolbaek/machine-learning-regularization) <sup>ðŸ”—</sup>  
  A project focused on regularization techniques to enhance model performance and generalization.
- [Linear & Logistic Regression](https://github.com/TernFolbaek/linear-and-logistic-regression) <sup>ðŸ”—</sup>  
  Implementing and understanding both linear and logistic regression for predictive modeling.
- [Decision Trees](https://github.com/TernFolbaek/decision-trees) <sup>ðŸ”—</sup>  
  An implementation of decision tree algorithms used for classification and regression tasks.
- [Gradient Descent](https://github.com/TernFolbaek/gradient-descent) <sup>ðŸ”—</sup>  
  Exploring the optimization technique essential for many machine learning models.
- [Binary & Multiclass Classification](https://github.com/TernFolbaek/binary-multiclass-classification) <sup>ðŸ”—</sup>  
  Classification models handling binary and multiclass data scenarios.
- [Angry Chatbot - Language sensitization model to filter angry text from a database](https://github.com/TernFolbaek/angry-chatbot) <sup>ðŸ”—</sup>  
  Trained a custom language model to detect and respond to aggressive language inputs.
- [Salary Prediction - Predicts salary based on parameters such as education, job role, and location](https://github.com/TernFolbaek/salary-prediction-ml) <sup>ðŸ”—</sup>  
  A machine learning model for salary prediction using multiple data features.
