## Tern Folbaek
Natural sciences is what got me hooked on software programming. The creation of software technology through the manipulation of the behavior of the real world which is still greatly unkown to us is what drove me to this field. Creating new technologies, optimizing current ones, problem solving is what makes me happy. 

My repos vary from practical apps which i thought to be useful, and repos which assist me in understanding complex topics in a more profound manner and which hopefully can help others in learning these topics in a more friendly approach. 

Apps:
[Anthra - platform for students across universities and courses to connect with each other](https://github.com/TernFolbaek/anthra)
