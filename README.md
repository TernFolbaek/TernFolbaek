My repositories range from practical apps that I found useful to projects that help me understand complex topics on a deeper level. These projects are designed to assist others in learning those topics more easily and intuitively.

### Apps:
- [Anthra - Platform for students across universities and courses to connect with each other](https://github.com/TernFolbaek/anthra) 
  An educational platform designed to help students collaborate across institutions and disciplines.

### Quantum Computation:
- [Single Systems - Quantum information and mathematics within single systems](https://github.com/TernFolbaek/quantum-computing/tree/main/basics-of-quantum-information/single_systems)  
  A deep dive into quantum information theory applied to individual quantum systems.
- [Multiple Systems - Quantum information and mathematics within multiple systems](https://github.com/TernFolbaek/quantum-computing/tree/main/basics-of-quantum-information/multiple-systems) 
  Exploration of the principles of quantum mechanics applied to systems with more than one quantum entity.

### Machine Learning:
- [ML Regularization - Techniques within machine learning to reduce overfitting](https://github.com/TernFolbaek/machine-learning-regularization) 
  A project focused on regularization techniques to enhance model performance and generalization.
- [Linear & Logistic Regression](https://github.com/TernFolbaek/linear-and-logistic-regression) 
  Implementing and understanding both linear and logistic regression for predictive modeling.
- [Decision Trees](https://github.com/TernFolbaek/decision-trees) <sup>ðŸ”—</sup>  
  An implementation of decision tree algorithms used for classification and regression tasks.
- [Gradient Descent](https://github.com/TernFolbaek/gradient-descent) <sup>ðŸ”—</sup>  
  Exploring the optimization technique essential for many machine learning models.
- [Binary & Multiclass Classification](https://github.com/TernFolbaek/binary-multiclass-classification)
  Classification models handling binary and multiclass data scenarios.
- [Angry Chatbot - Language sensitization model to filter angry text from a database](https://github.com/TernFolbaek/angry-chatbot) 
  Trained a custom language model to detect and respond to aggressive language inputs.
- [Salary Prediction - Predicts salary based on parameters such as education, job role, and location](https://github.com/TernFolbaek/salary-prediction-ml) 
  A machine learning model for salary prediction using multiple data features.
