# Terns's Portfolio 

Hi there, my name is Tern Folbaek: and I'm a student with a deep passion for **computer science** and **sciences** in general. I'm intrigued by the interplay of math and computer science and how they empower us to simulate scenarios that are otherwise difficult to visualize.

## About Me

I'm enthusiastic about applying my technical knowledge to create solutions that have a real impact (My projects dont necessarily reflect that but give me time ðŸ˜‚). I have experience in software engineering and AI, but my primary interest lies in the field of computer science as a whole.
Here, you'll find a collection of my projects and experiments that showcase my skills and interests in various areas of computer science.

## Skills

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, C++, HTML, Java
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: React, Flask, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
- **Tools**: Git, Jupyter Notebook, VSCode, Webpack
- **Databases**: MySQL, MongoDB, Firebase
- **Miscellaneous**: CSS, JEST, 

## Featured Projects

### Web Apps

- **[Keymaster](https://github.com/TernFolbaek/keymaster-frontend)**: An app to test your typing speed, where if logged-in, it will keep track of your highscore and you can then compare your score with fellow users under leadboard page.
- **[Blog](https://github.com/TernFolbaek/blog-frontend)**: A platform where users can sign in, post whatever is in their minds and follow along with what others post, allowing them to post comments on others blogs as well. 

### AI Projects

- **[angry chatbot]([link-to-ai-project-1](https://github.com/TernFolbaek/angry-chatbot))**: A chatbot which was trained upon a resentful data-set, subsequently making it reply in a negative tone.
- **[salary prediction](https://github.com/TernFolbaek/salary-prediction-ml)**: An app that predicts the salaries of various data-scientists positions, and software developers given certain input such as YOE, residency, job-rank.

### Computer Science Projects

- **[Linked List](https://github.com/TernFolbaek/linked-list)**: Code which allows the user to create a linked list, and allowing them to modify it with inbuilt-functions.
