# Terns' Portfolio 

Hi there, my name is Tern Folbaek: and I'm a student with a deep passion for **computer science** and **sciences** in general. I'm intrigued by the interplay of math and computer science and how they empower us to simulate scenarios that are otherwise difficult to visualize.

## About Me

I'm enthusiastic about applying my technical knowledge to create solutions that have a real impact (My projects dont necessarily reflect that but give me time ðŸ˜‚). I have experience in software engineering and AI, but my primary interest lies in the field of computer science as a whole.
Here, you'll find a collection of my projects and experiments that showcase my skills and interests in various areas of computer science.

## Skills

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, C++, HTML, Java
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: React, Flask, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
- **Tools**: Git, Jupyter Notebook, VSCode, Webpack
- **Databases**: MySQL, MongoDB, Firebase
- **Miscellaneous**: CSS, JEST,
