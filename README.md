Find it cool how we can manipulate the exact math/physics through 0s and 1s which the universe has applied to quite literally every element (as for as we know), through this manipulation we can simulate things which humans can't visualize, thus strengthening our bond with the universe and giving us a better understanding on everything. 

My interests engulf anything computation related, especially when this computation teaches itself :)

Taking a front-end approach to CS as i believe it is fundamental when learning the connections between computers, and how the interactions materialize.
